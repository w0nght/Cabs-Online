// Brief instructions on how to use the system
To use the function of booking a taxi in CabsOnline, needed to be a user of the system, to do so, existing user can log in via the login page, new customer can register via the register page.
After successful login to the system, users can see they are logged in as [user email] on the top right conner, users can then fill in a booking form to request a taix , but the booking only needs to be at least 40 minutes. The system will genarate a unique booking reference number which will be showed on a confirmation message, as well as a confirmation email. Users can log out of the system via a log out button.
An admin can access the system on the login page with the pre-set login credential, after logged in, admins can see a list of those unassigned booking requests ordered by timestamp, from the current time to within 3 hours period. Admins can also assign a taix for those booking requests, by simply entering the reference number and click the update button. When finished, admins can log out of the system via a log out button.
